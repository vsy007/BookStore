The account is situated within a framework provided by the natural sciences, particularly evolutionary biology. His main argument is that Sapiens came to dominate the world because it is the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric Sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals, along with numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of Sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money, and human rights.' },

Many philosophical issues are discussed such as the human experience, individualism, human emotion and consciousness. The book sets out to examine possibilities of the future of Homo sapiens. The premise outlines that during the 21st century, humanity is likely to make a significant attempt to gain happiness, immortality, and God-like powers. Throughout the book, Harari openly speculates various ways that this ambition might be realised in the future based on the past and present.' },

The work is a critique and revision of John Rawlss ideas in A Theory of Justice (1971). In this book, Sen makes a radical break with the traditional notion of homo economicus, or "rational economic man" as motivated mainly by self-interest. He points out that children have strong notions of "fairness" and acute aversion to "manifest injustice". Sen, says in the introduction to his book that... the strong perception of manifest injustice applies to adult human beings as well (as children) . What moves us, reasonably enough, is not the realization that the world falls short of being completely just – which few of us expect – but that there are clearly remediable injustices around us which we want to eliminate.' },

The book has had increased media attention and uptake in part due to Dr. Rajans much respected views on the economy and the political climate, but, also because of Rajans view on the demonetization exercise undertaken by the Government of India in October 2016. The demonetization exercise had mixed views from economists, with a majority (including Rajan) subscribing to the view that the short term pains inflicted would not justify any purported longer term gains. With that said, Dr Rajan himself is of the view that the data available currently is not fully substantive to determine if the program could be deemed a success.' },
